# Royce's Philosophy of Loyalty

## The rehabilitation of loyalty

In the wintry months of 1916, half a year before the USA was to declare its entry into the First World War, Josiah Royce died in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He had been a teacher and a prolific writer on history and philosophy. In his final work, begun in response to the outbreak of the Great War, he would write:

> Such [recent] converts to the doctrine that war is good ascribe their sudden conversion to the wonder and reverence which have been aroused in them by the sight of France regenerated ... awakened to a new sense that the value of life lies not in what individuals get out of it, but in what the exertions and the perils of war call out and illustrate, namely, the supreme and super-individual value of loyalty.
>

In the face of the brutality and human wastage of the war, this appeal to loyalty might have seemed naive. What is loyalty but a warrior's primitive justification for bloodlust? Or a soldier's blind trust in a nation that throws him into a meat grinder?

Six short years before the beginning of the first world war, Royce presented a series of lectures at the Lowell Institute in Boston. Royce's subject was loyalty, and his aim was its rehabilitation as a serious ethical concept.

For Royce, loyalty was the cornerstone, the 'central duty amongst all duties', the necessary foundation beneath all other virtues. If we only understand loyalty in the nationalistic and colonial sense so common in prewar times, basing our ethics on it would seem barbaric. But even in 1907, Royce was keenly aware of the abuses of loyalty and its historic marriage with oppression. His objective was to dispel what he saw as an 'ancient and disastrous association' between the idea of loyalty and the idea of war, and to inspire his audience to conduct their lives in the only way he believed could lead to individual fulfilment and complete satisfaction: the way of the utterly loyal.

## How to live a loyal life, and why you might want to

> To live a loyal life, whatever be one's cause, is to live in a way which is certainly free from many well-known sources of inner dissatisfaction.

What most endeared me to Royce's work is his sincere personal stake in this quest for loyalty. The introduction to his work _The Philosophy of Loyalty_ is an earnest explanation of his hope that he might not just instil in his audience a theoretical appreciation for loyalty, but a practical passion to live a loyal life. He laments what he sees as a recent indecision in ethics and philosophy, a hesitation brought about mainly by the rise of individualism.

Royce was careful not to argue for the mere maintenance of tradition. He cites Corinthians to 'say to tradition: that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die', meaning that sometimes the death of what's old is needed to bring new life. But he applies himself with urgency to 'clarifying and simplifying the tangled moral problems of our lives' - with the explicit aim of freeing people from introspection, freeing them to action.

See, Royce's idea of loyalty was, briefly, this: that devoting oneself willingly to a 'super-personal' cause, whatever the cause may be, and acting fervently in its service, is the only way of reaching real individual satisfaction in life. The three pillars of his definition are

* a willing devotion to a cause,
* the super-personal nature of the cause, and
* acting upon this devotion.

Without any of these three, loyalty becomes something else, something incapable of bearing the virtuous fruits of loyalty. Without willing freedom, we must consider devotion slavery _at best_. If a cause does not transcend the individual, it ignores the social nature of humans, and becomes mere self-interest. As Royce puts it, 'you can be loyal only to a tie that binds you and others into some sort of unity'. And if one does not act upon their feeling of devotion, well: it is 'mere emotion'.

At this point, it's easy to shrug and agree to disagree with Royce. Loyalty as he defines it _could_ be a foundation of ethics, but there's no reason it particularly _has_ to be. And these fruits of the loyal life - what are they?

To convince us of the need for loyalty to live lives of individual fulfilment, Royce takes as a starting place the individualist assertion that each of us must determine our own path through life. But how are we to do that? We are individuals, but social creatures. The discipline given to us by society chafes against our individual desires, but those desires are often conflicting, and rarely in our long-term interests. In the face of the impossibility of introspection, and the unsatisfactory examples set out for us by society, we must somehow chart a course - it is the great paradox, and the great task, that Royce sees at the centre of each person's life:

> To learn your own will, yes, to create your own will, is one of the largest of your human undertakings.
>
> [1][philosophy-of-loyalty] p. 31

Loyalty is a way of breaking the deadlock. It at once satisfies our desire to be in community with others, while allowing us to happily surrender our need to satisfy immediate instinctual desires.

Royce shows foresight when he adds an addendum to his definition, a disclamatory teaser of where he will go in future lectures:

> And now for a further word about the hardest part of this preliminary definition of loyalty: A loyal man, I have said, has a cause. I do not yet say that he has a good cause. He might have a bad one. I do not say, as yet, what makes a cause a good one, and worthy of loyalty. All that is to be considered here after.
